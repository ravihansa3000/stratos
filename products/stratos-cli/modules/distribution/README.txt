                        Apache Stratos CLI
================================================================================

Welcome to the Apache Stratos CLI.

The command line interface (CLI) is a powerful tool that clients can use
to communicate with Stratos services. The CLI distribution only includes one
jar file containing all dependent java libraries.

The tenant can use the CLI tool on two separate modes if needed, which 
are namely single command line mode and interactive mode. 

If the user executes with a command as an argument, the CLI tool 
will execute that command and exit with a status code. 

However, if there is no command as an argument, the CLI tool will 
enter into an interactive mode.

A user will be able to carryout all the following functions via the
CLI, with the exception of registering tenants and viewing logs.

The CLI tool also supports command history and auto-completing features 
in the interactive mode.
